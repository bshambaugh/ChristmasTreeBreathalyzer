# ChristmasTreeBreathalyzer
The Christmas Tree Breathalyzer is a gimmick project concieved and developed in the fall/winter of 2024. It consists of a HDPE case around a MP3 player, ESP32-C3, MQ3 Alcohol Sensor Board, Christmas Tree Circuit Board and Custom "MotherBoard" that connects components by a means that relays and indicates their state.

The Finished Product looks like ![finishedProduct.jpg](/photos/finishedProduct.jpg). 

The circuit without the case looks like [finishedProductNoCase.jpg](/photos/finishedProductNoCase.jpg). 

The plans for development are here [plans.jpg](/photos/plans.jpg).

The parts along with the plans are pictured here [partsAndPlans.jpg](/photos/partsAndPlans.jpg).

The "motherboard" looks like this:  [customMotherBoardView1.jpg](photos/customMotherBoardView1.jpg), [customMotherBoardView3.jpg](photos/customMotherBoardView3.jpg), [customMotherBoardView3.jpg](photos/customMotherBoardView3.jpg)

Possible improvements could entail adding a private key hidden from view that would enable creation of cryptographic signatures and exposure of a public key. Links based on the efuse are at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bshambaugh/b89d0d5e122b038896bcdb59fd6fbb13). This could allow for the following of the route taken with the [Blinky Project](https://github.com/bshambaugh/BlinkyProject) to develop a hardware based [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) Signer.
